Turn-based
Decide on grid size.
Players play a part in determining the opponent's board before the match begins.
Speak to wit.ai to enter valid words, which will determine the letters that populate the opponent's board. All letters, even the ones that are duplicates between words, will be included on the opponent's board. It is up to the opponent to determine how to arrange these words, and it is possible that letters originally included as duplicates will be extra because of intersecting words.
